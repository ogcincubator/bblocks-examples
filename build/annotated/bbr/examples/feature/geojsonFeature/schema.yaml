description: Example of a simple GeoJSON Feature specialisation. This example adds
  some custom properties from a reusable building block that could define properties
  for different Feature structures. This means that the semantic uplift (JSON-LD)
  context for the properties is simple and reusable, without the complications of
  mapping the Feature model to RDF - which is supported by the generic Feature building
  block, and combined here by the BuildingBlock tooling.
