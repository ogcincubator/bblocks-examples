## Feature Type based on a published schema

This example shows how an existing schema can be used to define a payload for a _container model_ such as the OGC API Features ```feature``` schema.

This particular example uses a schema defined in another message-oriented environment, and **highlights support for the practice of using JSON-LD contexts to document schemas.**

The OGC Building Blocks uses the same approach, with the added capabilities around example validation and mechanisms for composition into other structures. BuildingBlocks provides for transparent dependencies.
